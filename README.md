# Q-learning - Reinforcement learning 
In this project I explore Q-learning for optimizing the business process. We are given a task to find the shortest path from one point to another in a grid given below.

To solve this task a reinforcement technique is used. Q-learning is based on Markov's decision processes. Here it is implemented in three steps, where in the first place environment is defined, then Q-learning algorithm is implemented and finally it is put into a production. We can also define an intermidiary point where the robot needs to pass before reaching the destination.
